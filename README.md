This project aims to fill the gap of Reddit-based insights using text analysis methods, specifically as related to growing trends of Hindu nationalism in India.
The primary research questions are: 
1)  What are the dominant themes discussed in prominent Indian subreddits related to the Hindutva ideology?
2)  What are the dominant sentiments of users discussing the Hindutva ideology on Indian subreddits?
3)  Do some Indian subreddits engage in more extreme discussions of the Hindutva ideology than others?
